# scs-demoapps-kafka

These are the Spring Cloud Stream applications used for Solace PubSub+ Event Portal discovery demo against a Kafka broker and apps.

All apps can be used immediately against a fresh install of Kafka, they will create the topics as needed. All topics will be single partition by default, and consumers will be a single concurrency. All these can be modified as needed via the Application.yml.
